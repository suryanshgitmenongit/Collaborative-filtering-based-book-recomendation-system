## Introduction

This recommendation system utilizes collaborative filtering, a technique that makes automatic predictions about the preferences of a user by collecting preferences from many users (collaborating). In particular, it employs cosine similarity to measure the similarity between users or items based on their preferences.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering:** The system employs collaborative filtering to generate personalized movie recommendations.
- **Cosine Similarity:** The similarity between users or items is calculated using cosine similarity.
- **Scalability:** The system is designed to scale with a growing dataset of user preferences.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.x)
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
    ```

2. Change to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd movie-recommendation-system
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the recommendation system:

    ```bash
    python recommend_movies.ipynb
    ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input user preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations.


## Collaborative Filtering and Cosine Similarity

Collaborative filtering is a technique that makes automatic predictions about the preferences of a user by collecting preferences from many users (collaborating). In this system, cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity between users or items based on their preferences. The cosine of the angle between two vectors is computed, with a higher cosine indicating greater similarity.
